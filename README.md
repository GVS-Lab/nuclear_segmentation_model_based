# Evaluating segmentation
This repository contains code for evaluating instance segmentation models 

The _models_ folder contains some models that have been trained in the lab and will be continuously updated.

The model _tissue_nuclear_segmentation_ is trained to segment nuclei from a breast cancer tissue images. 
Ground truth dataset is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6b1z7wnm5h43ug0/AADuf4YJax8B1pqpBPJHx2yva?dl=0).
Evaluation of model performance can be found in _notebooks/tissue_nuclear_segmentation_quality_check.html_.
