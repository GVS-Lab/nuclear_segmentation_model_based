# Nuclear segmentation model based
This repository contains code for training and evaluating model based nuclear segmentation. 


The _models_ folder contains some models that have been trained in the lab and will be continuously updated. 

The model _tissue_nuclear_segmentation_ is trained to segment nuclei from a breast cancer tissue image. 
Ground truth data is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6b1z7wnm5h43ug0/AADuf4YJax8B1pqpBPJHx2yva?dl=0).
